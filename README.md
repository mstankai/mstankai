# mstankai's Toy Repository

I've created this repository to play around with various projects, and refresh myself on using git. In the future I aim to put some small projects and pieces of code here that I have written or will write.

### Things to do for me ...

A to do list:

- [x] Write a README
- [ ] Practice git:
  - [x] Create tasks
  - [x] Create a pull request
  - [ ] Solving merge conflicts
  - [x] Creating a fork and switching remotes
  - [ ] Downloading code from other repositories
  - [ ] Creating tags
  - [ ] Go through a git tutorial
- [x] Write some shell scripts
- [ ] Download a data set and explore using:
  - [ ] python scripts
  - [ ] jupyter notebook
- [ ] Write a toy ML code
